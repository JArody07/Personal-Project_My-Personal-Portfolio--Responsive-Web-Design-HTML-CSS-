        <p class="about-me-p">About Me<p>
        <p>I’m Jaser Arody Ramirez, a passionate Computer Science student and aspiring Data Analyst with a unique
            journey that began in 2022, around two years after high school. My path into technology wasn’t conventional,
            but my persistence and dedication are driving me to turn my dreams into reality. I embrace the unpredictability of
            my career path, viewing each twist and turn as a valuable part of my growth rather than a setback. I encourage others to see
            feeling lost or questioning choices as signs of exploration and development, not failure.</p>
        <p>I’m drawn to Data Analytics because it’s more than just numbers, it’s storytelling through data that reveals powerful insights
            about our lives and society. This field combines curiosity and creativity, sparking new discoveries with every dataset. My goal
            is to make Data Analytics accessible and inspiring, bridging the gap between knowledge and perseverance so others can overcome doubt
            and realize their own dreams.</p>
        <p>I invite anyone, whether a seasoned expert or beginner, to join me in exploring data’s mysteries, celebrating progress, and pushing boundaries
            together. Life’s too short for "what ifs", it’s time to embrace "why nots," using data as a launchpad for success. If you resonate with
            my journey or insights, I’d love to connect and hear your thoughts. Let’s ignite a data revolution together!</p>
